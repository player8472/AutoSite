If you don't use Tamil language, ignore this file.

Tamil is not one of the officially supported locale by Java. But there is a workaround for this.

If you wish to use Neembuu Uploader in Tamil, kindly copy the included 'LATHA.TTF' font to
"<JRE_INSTALL_DIR>/jre/lib/fonts/fallback"

Location to paste the fallback font for your pc is:
"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_31\jre\lib\fonts\fallback\"
